## NOTE

- I used a free api for this application which has request/rate limit, so dont be shocked if you encounter a 429 error

- While testing (the downloaded apk), keep in mind that I used a free news API (https://newsapi.org/). As such, if you encounter a 429 error (Too many request), it means that too many request has been sent within that time, you would have to wait before sending a request

- While running on Android Studio, make sure you use your own API_KEY
